                                The first peoples to inhabit the Philippines migrated more than 4,000 years ago from what is today southern China. These peoples did not just populate the Philippines but dispersed throughout Southeast Asia.
                                Early settlements of the Philippine archipelago occurred along rivers which kept populations somewhat isolated from one another. Rivers provided natural resources (water and protein via seafood) to sustain small communities. While these settlements were scattered along rivers, they did not develop a political center. Instead, early settlers saw themselves in relation to smaller communities and developed local alliances and allegiances.

                                In 1521, Ferdinand Magellan landed in the Philippines and was killed by Filipinos in a battle between two tribes. 
                                Spain continued to try to settle the Philippines for 40 unsuccessful years until 1565 when Miguel López de Legazpi established the first permanent Spanish settlement in Cebu. From there, the Spanish slowly took over the Islamic control that had been in place since 1300s and replaced their empire with a Catholic one. More Spanish arrived from Mexico, reaffirming the beginning of the Spanish Philippines. 
                                While the conquistadores took land and overruled local authorities, Catholic friars established churches, schools, and aid. This combination assured a solid Spanish influence in the Philippines that lasted for centuries and still lingers today.

As the Spanish surrenders the Philippines and several islands into the American's hand during the Tready of Paris, the American deemed Filipinos that their are incapable of self-governing as a result of that the republic of malolos was not recognized.
                                Resulting in Philippine-American War, after the war the American imposes rules, and new culture to the Philippines such as education, free-trade system, democratic system and many more.

                                The Japanese military authorities immediately began organizing a new government structure in the Philippines after they take the Philippines from American grasp. Although the Japanese had promised independence for the islands after occupation, they initially organized a Council of State through which they directed civil affairs until October 1943, when they declared the Philippines an independent republic. Most of the Philippine elite, with a few notable exceptions, served under the Japanese. 
                                The puppet republic was headed by President José P. Laurel. Philippine collaboration in puppet government began under Jorge B. Vargas, who was originally appointed by Quezon as the mayor of City of Greater Manila before Quezon departed Manila. In addition, many war crimes committed by forces of the Empire of Japan against surrendered Allied forces and civilians were documented. they have imparted some of their cultures to us through strict law such as haiku.

Sites that would live up to anyone's fantasy of a pristine South Pacific paradise of white sand beaches and crystal blue waters, they are a popular destination for tourists from around the world. 
                                The interior of the country is generally mountainous, with several mountain peaks reaching almost 10,000 feet. There are numerous volcanoes in the country, and some are frequently active. in addition, it has vast fertile plains and features scenic hills, valleys, and rivers. The Climate of the Philippines is tropical and maritime. It is similar in many respects to the climate of the countries of Central America. 
                                It has relatively high temperature, high humidity and abundant rainfall.
